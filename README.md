Udacity Robotics Nano Degree

This is the final project for udacity Robotics nano degree.

The goal of this project is for a Robot to go to a destination and pickup an object. Once the object is picked up it will take it to a dropoff location. Both locations are specified in the Add_Marker package.

The world files and map files are located in the src/map directory and are referenced in the launch files of the turtlebot package along with the robot initial pose.

I had some issues with symlinks when pushing to git, I copied the symlink folder to a flat folder and left the symlink name. That's in the "flat" commit.
